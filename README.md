**Course:** Back-End Programming – Spring REST API for Legacy Migration  
**Tech Stack:** Java · Spring Boot · Spring Data JPA · MySQL · REST APIs · Lombok · GitLab

---

## 📋 Overview  
This RESTful API modernizes a legacy 1990s travel booking system using Java and Spring Boot. It supports full customer and vacation package management, with database persistence, input validation, and DTO-based API responses. The backend is designed to connect seamlessly with an Angular front-end and a MySQL database.

## 🎯 Features
- RESTful API endpoints for creating, updating, and deleting bookings
- MVC structure with controllers, services, and repositories
- DTOs and validation for clean, secure request/response handling
- Entity relationships managed with Spring Data JPA
- Sample customer data seeded on application startup
- Supports integration with front-end and external tools (e.g., Postman)
